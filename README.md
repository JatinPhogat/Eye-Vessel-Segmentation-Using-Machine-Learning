# Fundus Retinal Vessel Segmentation  

## Overview  
This project focuses on **retinal vessel segmentation** using a **hybrid deep learning approach** combining **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and U-Net**. The objective is to extract blood vessels from fundus images accurately, supporting medical diagnosis for **diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and other ocular diseases**. The model incorporates **advanced preprocessing, adversarial learning, and evaluation metrics** to enhance segmentation performance.

## Dataset  
The model is trained and tested using the **DRIVE dataset** (Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction), a well-known dataset for retinal vessel segmentation. It includes high-resolution fundus images along with expert-annotated vessel masks.

**Dataset Link:** [DRIVE Dataset](https://drive.grand-challenge.org/)  

## Methodology  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing  
- **Contrast Enhancement:** Applied **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)** to improve vessel visibility.  
- **Grayscale Conversion & Mask Binarization:** Enhanced contrast for better segmentation.  
- **Data Augmentation:** Performed **random flipping and rotation** to improve generalization.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architecture  
- **Generator:** A **U-Net-based architecture** for precise vessel segmentation.  
- **Discriminator:** A **CNN-based discriminator** that distinguishes real vessel masks from generated ones.
